252.227-7013  Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items.

As prescribed in 227.7103-6(a), use the following clause:

 

RIGHTS IN TECHNICAL DATA--NONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (FEB 2014)

 

      (a)  Definitions.  As used in this clause—

 

              (1)  “Computer data base” means a collection of data recorded in a form capable of being processed by a computer.  The term does not include computer software.

 

              (2)  “Computer program” means a set of instructions, rules, or routines recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to perform a specific operation or series of operations.

 

 

              (3)  “Computer software” means computer programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled.  Computer software does not include computer data bases or computer software documentation.

 

              (4)  “Computer software documentation” means owner's manuals, user's manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using the software.

 

              (5)  "Covered Government support contractor" means a contractor (other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204-7014) under a contract, the primary purpose of which is to furnish independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government’s management and oversight of a program or effort (rather than to directly furnish an end item or service to accomplish a program or effort), provided that the contractor—

 

                    (i)  Is not affiliated with the prime contractor or a first-tier subcontractor on the program or effort, or with any direct competitor of such prime contractor or any such first-tier subcontractor in furnishing end items or services of the type developed or produced on the program or effort; and

 

                    (ii)  Receives access to technical data or computer software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.

 

              (6)  “Detailed manufacturing or process data” means technical data that describe the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or component or to perform a process.

 

              (7)  “Developed” means that an item, component, or process exists and is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered “developed,” the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code.

 

              (8)  “Developed exclusively at private expense” means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.

 

                    (i)  Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.

 

                    (ii)  Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense.

 

              (9)  “Developed exclusively with government funds” means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.

 

              (10)  “Developed with mixed funding” means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.

 

              (11)  “Form, fit, and function data” means technical data that describes the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items.

 

              (12)  “Government purpose” means any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations.  Government purposes include competitive procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so.

 

              (13)  “Government purpose rights” means the rights to—

 

                    (i)  Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data within the Government without restriction; and

 

                    (ii)  Release or disclose technical data outside the Government and authorize persons to whom release or disclosure has been made to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose that data for United States government purposes.

 

              (14)  “Limited rights” means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except that the Government may reproduce, release, or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the Government if—

 

                    (i)  The reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is—

 

                            (A)  Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or

 

                            (B)  A release or disclosure to—

 

                                    (1)  A covered Government support contractor in performance of its covered Government support contract for use, modification, reproduction, performance, display, or release or disclosure to a person authorized to receive limited rights technical data; or

 

                                    (2)  A foreign government, of technical data other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use of such data by the foreign government is in the interest of the Government and is required for evaluational or informational purposes;

 

                    (ii)  The recipient of the technical data is subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release, disclosure, or use of the technical data; and

 

                    (iii)  The contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such reproduction, release, disclosure, or use.

 

              (15)  “Technical data” means recorded information, regardless of the form or method of the recording, of a scientific or technical nature (including computer software documentation).  The term does not include computer software or data incidental to contract administration, such as financial and/or management information.

 

              (16)  “Unlimited rights” means rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose technical data in whole or in part, in any manner, and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or authorize others to do so.

 

      (b)  Rights in technical data.  The Contractor grants or shall obtain for the Government the following royalty free, world-wide, nonexclusive, irrevocable license rights in technical data other than computer software documentation (see the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause of this contract for rights in computer software documentation):

 

              (1)  Unlimited rights.  The Government shall have unlimited rights in technical data that are—

 

                    (i)  Data pertaining to an item, component, or process which has been or will be developed exclusively with Government funds;

 

                    (ii)  Studies, analyses, test data, or similar data produced for this contract, when the study, analysis, test, or similar work was specified as an element of performance;

 

                    (iii)  Created exclusively with Government funds in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes;

 

                    (iv)  Form, fit, and function data;

 

                    (v)  Necessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training purposes (other than detailed manufacturing or process data);

 

                    (vi)  Corrections or changes to technical data furnished to the Contractor by the Government;

However, if the Government desires to obtain additional rights in technical data in which it has limited rights, the Contractor agrees to promptly enter into negotiations with the Contracting Officer to determine whether there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights.  All technical data in which the Contractor has granted the Government additional rights shall be listed or described in a license agreement made part of the contract.  The license shall enumerate the additional rights granted the Government in such data.

 

                    (iv)  The Contractor acknowledges that—

                            (C)  The Contractor (or the party asserting restrictions as identified in the limited rights legend) may require each such covered Government support contractor to enter into a non-disclosure agreement directly with the Contractor (or the party asserting restrictions) regarding the covered Government support contractor’s use of such data, or alternatively, that the Contractor (or party asserting restrictions) may waive in writing the requirement for a non-disclosure agreement; and

The standard license rights granted to the Government under paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this clause, including the period during which the Government shall have government purpose rights in technical data, may be modified by mutual agreement to provide such rights as the parties consider appropriate but shall not provide the Government lesser rights than are enumerated in paragraph (a)(14) of this clause.  Any rights so negotiated shall be identified in a license agreement made part of this contract.

 

              (5)  Prior government rights.  Technical data that will be delivered, furnished, or otherwise provided to the Government under this contract, in which the Government has previously obtained rights shall be delivered, furnished, or provided with the pre-existing rights, unless—

The Contractor shall not, without the written approval of the Contracting Officer, incorporate any copyrighted data in the technical data to be delivered under this contract unless the Contractor is the copyright owner or has obtained for the Government the license rights necessary to perfect a license or licenses in the deliverable data of the appropriate scope set forth in paragraph (b) of this clause, and has affixed a statement of the license or licenses obtained on behalf of the Government and other persons to the data transmittal document.

 

      (e)  Identification and delivery of data to be furnished with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure.

 

              (1)  This paragraph does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright.

 

              (2)  Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, technical data that the Contractor asserts should be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure are identified in an attachment to this contract (the Attachment).  The Contractor shall not deliver any data with restrictive markings unless the data are listed on the Attachment.

 

              (3)  In addition to the assertions made in the Attachment, other assertions may be identified after award when based on new information or inadvertent omissions unless the inadvertent omissions would have materially affected the source selection decision.  Such identification and assertion shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer as soon as practicable prior to the scheduled date for delivery of the data, in the following format, and signed by an official authorized to contractually obligate the Contractor:

(End of identification and assertion)

 

              (4)  When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's assertions.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and validate any listed assertion, at a later date, in accordance with the procedures of the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract.

 

      (f)  Marking requirements.  The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data to be delivered under this contract by marking the deliverable data subject to restriction.  Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this clause, only the following legends are authorized under this contract: the government purpose rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the limited rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause; or the special license rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause; and/or a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.

 

              (1)  General marking instructions.  The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend on all technical data that qualify for such markings.  The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed material containing technical data for which restrictions are asserted.  When only portions of a page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier.  Technical data transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions.  Reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.

 

              (2)  Government purpose rights markings.  Data delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with government purpose rights shall be marked as follows:

 

GOVERNMENT PURPOSE RIGHTS

 

 
	

Contract No.
	

 
	

 

 
	

Contractor Name
	

 
	

 

 
	

Contractor Address
	

 
	

 

 
	

 
	

 
	

 

 
	

Expiration Date
	

 
	

 
									

 

              The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph (b)(2) of the Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items clause contained in the above identified contract.  No restrictions apply after the expiration date shown above.  Any reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings.

 

(End of legend)

 

              (3)  Limited rights markings.  Data delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with limited rights shall be marked with the following legend:

 

LIMITED RIGHTS

 

 
	

Contract No.
	

 
	

 

 
	

Contractor Name
	

 
	

 

 
	

Contractor Address
	

 
	

 

 
	

 
	

 
	

 
								

 

              The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph (b)(3) of the Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause contained in the above identified contract.  Any reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings.  Any person, other than the Government, who has been provided access to such data must promptly notify the above named Contractor.

 

(End of legend)

 

              (4)  Special license rights markings.

 

                    (i)  Data in which the Government's rights stem from a specifically negotiated license shall be marked with the following legend:

 

SPECIAL LICENSE RIGHTS

 

The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these data are restricted by Contract No. _____(Insert contract number)____, License No. ____(Insert license identifier)____.  Any reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings.

 

(End of legend)

 

                    (ii)  For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (b)(5) of this clause).

 

              (5)  Pre-existing data markings.  If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data deliverable under this contract, and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such data with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data qualified under the prior contract or license.  The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.

 

      (g)  Contractor procedures and records.  Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data with other than unlimited rights, shall—

 

              (1)  Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and

              (2)  Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on technical data delivered under this contract.

 

      (h)  Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings.

 

              (1)  Unjustified technical data markings.  The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical data furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract.  Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the procedures in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.

 

              (2)  Nonconforming technical data markings.  A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on technical data delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract.  Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract.  If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such marking within sixty (60) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming marking.

 

      (i)  Relation to patents.  Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.

 

      (j)  Limitation on charges for rights in technical data.

 

              (1)  The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including, but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical data to be delivered under this contract when—

 

                    (i)  The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data; or

 

                    (ii)  The data are available to the public without restrictions.

 

              (2)  The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause—

 

                    (i)  Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor or supplier technical data, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and

 

                    (ii)  Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data will be delivered.

 

      (k)  Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers.

 

              (1)  The Contractor shall ensure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes of paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized and protected.

 

              (2)  Whenever any technical data for noncommercial items, or for commercial items developed in any part at Government expense, is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, including subcontracts or other contractual instruments for commercial items, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. This clause will govern the technical data pertaining to noncommercial items or to any portion of a commercial item that was developed in any part at Government expense, and the clause at 252.227-7015 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item that was developed exclusively at private expense. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher-tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data.

 

              (3)  Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.  However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.

 

              (4)  The Contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data from their subcontractors or suppliers.

 

              (5)  In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.

              (2)  The Government shall not publish a deliverable technical data item or items identified in this contract as being subject to paragraph (l) of this clause or authorize others to publish such data on its behalf if, prior to publication for sale by the Government and within twenty-four (24) months following the date specified in this contract for delivery of such data or the removal of any national security or export control restrictions, whichever is later, the Contractor publishes that item or items for sale and promptly notifies the Contracting Officer of such publication(s).  Any such publication shall include a notice identifying the number of this contract and the Government's rights in the published data.

      (f)  Marking requirements.  The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software by marking the deliverable software or documentation subject to restriction.  Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this clause, only the following legends are authorized under this contract: the government purpose rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the restricted rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause; or the special license rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause; and/or a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.

 

              (1)  General marking instructions.  The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend on all computer software that qualify for such markings.  The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or software storage container and each page, or portions thereof, of printed material containing computer software for which restrictions are asserted.  Computer software transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions.  However, instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will or might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat conditions, unless the Contracting Officer's written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery.  Reproductions of computer software or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.

 

              (2)  Government purpose rights markings.  Computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with government purpose rights shall be marked as follows:

(End of legend)

 

                    (ii)  For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (b)(5) of this clause).

 

              (5)  Pre-existing markings.  If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software or computer software documentation and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such software or documentation with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the software qualified under the prior contract or license.  The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.

 

      (g)  Contractor procedures and records.  Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver computer software or computer software documentation with other than unlimited rights, shall—

Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the procedures of those clauses, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.

 

              (2)  Nonconforming computer software or computer software documentation markings.  A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on computer software or computer software documentation delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract.  Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software or the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract.  If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such markings within sixty (60) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings.

 

      (i)  Relation to patents.  Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.

 

      (j)  Limitation on charges for rights in computer software or computer software documentation.

 

              (1)  The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited to license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered under this contract when—

 

                    (i)  The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the software or documentation; or

 

                    (ii)  The software or documentation are available to the public without restrictions.

 

              (2)  The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause—

 

                    (i)  Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor or supplier computer software or computer software documentation, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and

 

                    (ii)  Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the software or documentation will be delivered.

 

      (k)  Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers.

 

              (1)  Whenever any noncommercial computer software or computer software documentation is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in its subcontracts or other contractual instruments, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties.  No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's computer software or computer software documentation.

 

              (2)  The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in computer software or computer software documentation from their subcontractors or suppliers.

 

              (3)  The Contractor shall ensure that subcontractor or supplier rights are recognized and protected in the identification, assertion, and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause.

 

              (4)  In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in computer software or computer software documentation as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.

                    (iii)  Has not been offered, sold, leased, or licensed to the public but will be available for commercial sale, lease, or license in time to satisfy the delivery requirements of this contract; or

 

                    (iv)  Satisfies a criterion expressed in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this clause and would require only minor modification to meet the requirements of this contract.

 

              (2)  “Computer database” means a collection of recorded data in a form capable of being processed by a computer.  The term does not include computer software.

 

              (3)  “Computer program” means a set of instructions, rules, or routines, recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to perform a specific operation or series of operations.

 

              (4)  “Computer software” means computer programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae, and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled.  Computer software does not include computer databases or computer software documentation.

                    (i)  (Applicable to technical data other than computer software documentation.)  An item, component, or process, exists and is workable.  Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced.  Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended.  Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art.  To be considered “developed,” the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code;

 

                    (ii)  A computer program has been successfully operated in a computer and tested to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the program can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose;

 

                    (iii)  Computer software, other than computer programs, has been tested or analyzed to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the software can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose; or

 

                    (iv)  Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a contract has been written, in any medium, in sufficient detail to comply with requirements under that contract.

 

              (9)  “Developed exclusively at private expense” means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.

 

                    (i)  Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.

 

                    (ii)  Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense.

 

              (10)  “Developed exclusively with government funds” means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.

 

              (11)  “Developed with mixed funding” means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.

 

              (12)  “Form, fit, and function data” means technical data that describe the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items.

              (15)  “Limited rights” means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except that the Government may reproduce, release, or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the Government if—

 

                    (i)  The production, release, disclosure, or use is—

 

                            (A)  Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or

 

                            (B)  A release or disclosure to—

                            (A)  The Government notifies the party which has granted restricted rights that a release or disclosure to particular contractors or subcontractors was made;

 

                            (B)  Such contractors or subcontractors are subject to the non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement or are Government contractors receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends;

(End of identification and assertion)

 

              (4)  When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's assertions.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and validate any listed assertions, at a later date, in accordance with the procedures of the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software and/or Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clauses of this contract.

 

      (f)  Marking requirements.  The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract by marking the deliverable data or software subject to restriction.  Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this clause, only the following markings are authorized under this contract: the limited rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the restricted rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause, the SBIR data rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause, or the special license rights legend at paragraph (f)(5) of this clause; and/or a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.

 

              (1)  General marking instructions.  The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend to all technical data and computer software that qualify for such markings.  The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed material containing technical data or computer software for which restrictions are asserted.  When only portions of a page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier.  Technical data or computer software transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions.  However, instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will or might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat conditions, unless the Contracting Officer's written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery.  Reproductions of technical data, computer software, or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.

 

              (2)  Limited rights markings.  Technical data not generated under this contract that pertain to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense and delivered or otherwise furnished with limited rights shall be marked with the following legend:

                    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph (b)(2) of the Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program clause contained in the above identified contract.  Any reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings.  Any person, other than the Government, who has been provided access to such data must promptly notify the above named Contractor.

 

(End of legend)

 

              (3)  Restricted rights markings.  Computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with restricted rights shall be marked with the following legend:

                    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose this software are restricted by paragraph (b)(3) of the Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software--Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program clause contained in the above identified contract.  Any reproduction of computer software or portions thereof marked with this legend must

also reproduce the markings.  Any person, other than the Government, who has been provided access to such software must promptly notify the above named Contractor.

 

(End of legend)

 

              (4)  SBIR data rights markings.  Except for technical data or computer software in which the Government has acquired unlimited rights under paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, or negotiated special license rights as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this clause, technical data or computer software generated under this contract shall be marked with the following legend.  The Contractor shall enter the expiration date for the SBIR data rights period on the legend:

 

SBIR DATA RIGHTS

                    The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software marked with this legend are restricted during the period shown as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of the Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program clause contained in the above identified contract.  No restrictions apply after the expiration date shown above.  Any reproduction of technical data, computer software, or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings.

 

(End of legend)

 

              (5)  Special license rights markings.

 

                    (i)  Technical data or computer software in which the Government's rights stem from a specifically negotiated license shall be marked with the following legend:

 

SPECIAL LICENSE RIGHTS

 

The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose this technical data or computer software  are restricted by Contract No. _____(Insert contract number)____, License No. ____(Insert license identifier)____.  Any reproduction of technical data, computer software, or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings.

 

(End of legend)

 

                    (ii)  For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (b)(6) of this clause).

 

              (6)  Pre-existing data markings.  If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software, and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such data or software with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data or software qualified under the prior contract or license.  The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.

 

      (g)  Contractor procedures and records.  Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data or computer software with other than unlimited rights, shall—

 

              (1)  Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and

 

              (2)  Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on technical data or computer software delivered under this contract.

 

      (h)  Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings.

 

              (1)  Unjustified markings.  The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical data or computer software furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data and the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software clauses of this contract, respectively.  Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the applicable procedures of those clauses, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.

 

              (2)  Nonconforming markings.  A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on technical data or computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract.  Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data or the Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software clause of this contract.  If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such markings within sixty (60) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings.

 

      (i)  Relation to patents.  Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.

 

      (j)  Limitation on charges for rights in technical data or computer software.

 

              (1)  The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract when—

 

                    (i)  The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data or software; or

 

                    (ii)  The data are available to the public without restrictions.

 

              (2)  The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause—

 

                    (i)  Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor or supplier technical data or computer software, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and

 

                    (ii)  Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data or computer software will be delivered.

 

      (k)  Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers.

 

              (1)  The Contractor shall assure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized and protected.

 

              (2)  Whenever any noncommercial technical data or computer software is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties.  The Contractor shall use the Technical Data—Commercial Items clause of this contract to obtain technical data pertaining to commercial items, components, or processes.  No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.

 

              (3)  Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.  However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.

 

              (4)  The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.

 

              (5)  In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.

 

(End of clause)

 

ALTERNATE I (JUN 1995)

As prescribed in 227.7104(d), add the following paragraph (l) to the basic clause:

 

      (l)  Publication for sale.

 

              (1)  This paragraph applies only to technical data or computer software delivered to the Government with SBIR data rights.

 

              (2)  Upon expiration of the SBIR data rights period, the Government will not exercise its right to publish or authorize others to publish an item of technical data or computer software identified in this contract as being subject to paragraph (l) of this clause if the Contractor, prior to the expiration of the SBIR data rights period, or within two years following delivery of the data or software item, or within twenty-four months following the removal of any national security or export control restrictions, whichever is later, publishes such data or software item(s) and promptly notifies the Contracting Officer of such publication(s).  Any such publication(s) shall include a notice identifying the number of this contract and the Government's rights in the published data.

 

              (3)  This limitation on the Government's right to publish for sale shall continue as long as the technical data or computer software are reasonably available to the public for purchase.

 

252.227-7019  Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software.

As prescribed in 227.7104(e)(3) or 227.7203-6(c), use the following clause:

 

VALIDATION OF ASSERTED RESTRICTIONS—COMPUTER SOFTWARE

(SEP 2016)

 

      (a)  Definitions.

 

              (1)  As used in this clause, unless otherwise specifically indicated, the term “Contractor” means the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers.

 

              (2)  Other terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause of this contract.

 

      (b)  Justification.  The Contractor shall maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any markings that assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose computer software delivered or required to be delivered under this contract and shall be prepared to furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a request for information under paragraph (d) or a challenge under paragraph (f) of this clause.

 

      (c)  Direct contact with subcontractors or suppliers.  The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors or suppliers at any tier who assert restrictions on the Government's right to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software.  Neither this clause, nor any action taken by the Government under this clause, creates or implies privity of contract between the Government and the Contractor's subcontractors or suppliers.

 

      (d)  Requests for information.

 

              (1)  The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor to provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's asserted restrictions.  Such information shall be based upon the records required by this clause or other information reasonably available to the Contractor.

 

              (2)  Based upon the information provided, if the—

 

                    (i)  Contractor agrees that an asserted restriction is not valid, the Contracting Officer may—

 

                            (A)  Strike or correct the unjustified marking at the Contractor's expense; or

 

                            (B)  Return the computer software to the Contractor for correction at the Contractor's expense.  If the Contractor fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected software to the Contracting Officer within sixty (60) days following receipt of the software, the Contracting Officer may correct or strike the markings at that Contractor's expense.

 

                    (ii)  Contracting Officer concludes that the asserted restriction is appropriate for this contract, the Contracting Officer shall so notify the Contractor in writing.

 

              (3)  The Contractor's failure to provide a timely response to a Contracting Officer's request for information or failure to provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate an asserted restriction shall constitute reasonable grounds for questioning the validity of an asserted restriction.

 

      (e)  Government right to challenge and validate asserted restrictions.

 

              (1)  The Government, when there are reasonable grounds to do so, has the right to review and challenge the validity of any restrictions asserted by the Contractor on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software delivered, to be delivered under this contract, or otherwise provided to the Government in the performance of this contract.  Except for software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available without restrictions, the Government may exercise this right only within three years after the date(s) the software is delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government, or three years following final payment under this contract, whichever is later.

 

              (2)  The absence of a challenge to an asserted restriction shall not constitute validation under this clause.  Only a Contracting Officer's final decision or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.

 

      (f)  Challenge procedures.

 

              (1)  A challenge must be in writing and shall—

 

                    (i)  State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction;

                    (iii)  Require the Contractor to provide justification for the assertion based upon records kept in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause and such other documentation that are reasonably available to the Contractor, in sufficient detail to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the validity of the asserted restrictions; and

              (1)  The Government agrees that, notwithstanding a Contracting Officer's final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction and except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this clause, it will honor the asserted restriction—

              (3)  The agency head, on a nondelegable basis, may determine that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit awaiting the filing of suit in an appropriate court, or the rendering of a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals. In that event, the agency head shall notify the Contractor of the urgent or compelling circumstances.

                    (i)  Any restrictive marking on such computer software shall be struck or corrected at the Contractor's expense or ignored; and

 

                    (ii)  If the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in challenging the restriction, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.

 

              (2)  Not sustained—

 

                    (i)  The Government shall be bound by the asserted restriction; and

 

                    (ii)  If the challenge by the Government is found not to have been made in good faith, the Government shall be liable to the Contractor for payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor in defending the restriction.

 

      (i)  Flowdown.  The Contractor shall insert this clause in all contracts, purchase orders, and other similar instruments with its subcontractors or suppliers, at any tier, who will be furnishing computer software to the Government in the performance of this contract.

252.227-7037  Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data.

As prescribed in 227.7102-4(c), 227.7103-6(e)(3), 227.7104(e)(5), or 227.7203-6(f), use the following clause:

 

VALIDATION OF RESTRICTIVE MARKINGS ON TECHNICAL DATA (SEP 2016)

 

      (a)  Definitions.  The terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items clause of this contract.

 

      (b)  Presumption regarding development exclusively at private expense.

 

              (1)  Commercial items.

 

                    (i)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will presume that the Contractor’s or a subcontractor’s asserted use or release restrictions with respect to a commercial item is justified on the basis that the item was developed exclusively at private expense.

 

                    (ii)  The Contracting Officer will not challenge such assertions unless the Contracting Officer has information that demonstrates that the commercial item was not developed exclusively at private expense.

 

              (2)  Major weapon systems.  In the case of a challenge to a use or release restriction that is asserted with respect to data of the Contractor or a subcontractor for a major weapon system or a subsystem or component thereof on the basis that the major weapon system, subsystem, or component was developed exclusively at private expense—

 

                    (i)  The presumption in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause applies to—

 

                            (A)  A commercial subsystem or component of a major weapon system, if the major weapon system was acquired as a commercial item in accordance with DFARS subpart 234.70 (10 U.S.C. 2379(a));

 

                            (B)  A component of a subsystem, if the subsystem was acquired as a commercial item in accordance with DFARS subpart 234.70 (10 U.S.C. 2379(b)); and

 

                            (C)  Any other component, if the component is a commercially available off-the-shelf item or a commercially available off-the-shelf item with modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace or minor modifications made to meet Federal Government requirements; and

 

                    (ii)  In all other cases, the challenge to the use or release restriction will be sustained unless information provided by the Contractor or a subcontractor demonstrates that the item or process was developed exclusively at private expense.

 

      (c)  Justification.  The Contractor or subcontractor at any tier is responsible for maintaining records sufficient to justify the validity of its markings that impose restrictions on the Government and others to use, duplicate, or disclose technical data delivered or required to be delivered under the contract or subcontract.  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall be prepared to furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a challenge under paragraph (e) of this clause.

 

      (d)  Prechallenge request for information.

 

              (1)  The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish a written explanation for any restriction asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor on the right of the United States or others to use technical data.  If, upon review of the explanation submitted, the Contracting Officer remains unable to ascertain the basis of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer may further request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the records of, or otherwise in the possession of or reasonably available to, the Contractor or subcontractor to justify the validity of any restrictive marking on technical data delivered or to be delivered under the contract or subcontract (e.g., a statement of facts accompanied with supporting documentation).  The Contractor or subcontractor shall submit such written data as requested by the Contracting Officer within the time required or such longer period as may be mutually agreed.

 

              (2)  If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written data furnished pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive marking, determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the marking and that continued adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer shall follow the procedures in paragraph (e) of this clause.

 

              (3)  If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's request for information under paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, and the Contracting Officer determines that continued adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer may challenge the validity of the marking as described in paragraph (e) of this clause.

 

      (e)  Challenge.

 

              (1)  Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, if the Contracting Officer determines that a challenge to the restrictive marking is warranted, the Contracting Officer shall send a written challenge notice to the Contractor or subcontractor asserting the restrictive markings.  Such challenge shall—

 

                    (i)  State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction;

 

                    (ii)  Require a response within sixty (60) days justifying and providing sufficient evidence as to the current validity of the asserted restriction;

 

                    (iii)  State that a DoD Contracting Officer's final decision, issued pursuant to paragraph (g) of this clause, sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking identical to the asserted restriction, within the three-year period preceding the challenge, shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction if the validated restriction was asserted by the same Contractor or subcontractor (or any licensee of such Contractor or subcontractor) to which such notice is being provided; and

 

                    (iv)  State that failure to respond to the challenge notice may result in issuance of a final decision pursuant to paragraph (f) of this clause.

 

              (2)  The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response as appropriate if the Contractor or subcontractor submits a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.

 

              (3)  The Contractor's or subcontractor's written response shall be considered a claim within the meaning of 41 U.S.C. 7101, Contract Disputes, and shall be certified in the form prescribed at 33.207 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, regardless of dollar amount.

 

              (4)  A Contractor or subcontractor receiving challenges to the same restrictive markings from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each Contracting Officer of the existence of more than one challenge.  The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge.  The Contracting Officer initiating the first in time unanswered challenge after consultation with the Contractor or subcontractor and the other Contracting Officers, shall formulate and distribute a schedule for responding to each of the challenge notices to all interested parties.  The schedule shall afford the Contractor or subcontractor an opportunity to respond to each challenge notice.  All parties will be bound by this schedule.

 

      (f)  Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond.  Upon a failure of a Contractor or subcontractor to submit any response to the challenge notice the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause and the Disputes clause of this contract pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.  This final decision shall be issued as soon as possible after the expiration of the time period of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) or (e)(2) of this clause.  Following issuance of the final decision, the Contracting Officer will comply with the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this clause.

 

      (g)  Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor responds.

 

              (1)  If the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor or subcontractor has justified the validity of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor sustaining the validity of the restrictive marking, and stating that the Government will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking.  This final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require.  The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.

 

              (2)(i)  If the Contracting Officer determines that the validity of the restrictive marking is not justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract.  Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of the Disputes clause, the final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor of the longer period that the Government will require.  The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.

 

                    (ii)  The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking for a period of ninety (90) days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause.  The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that, if it intends to file suit in the United States Claims Court it will provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause.  If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to appeal, file suit, or provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within the ninety (90)-day period, the Government may cancel or ignore the restrictive markings, and the failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to take the required action constitutes agreement with such Government action.

 

                    (iii)  The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking where a notice of intent to file suit in the United States Claims Court is provided to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) days from the issuance of the final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause.  The Government will no longer be bound, and the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Government may strike or ignore the restrictive markings, if the Contractor or subcontractor fails to file its suit within one (1) year after issuance of the final decision.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may, following notice to the Contractor or subcontractor, authorize release or disclosure of the technical data.  Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.

 

                    (iv)  The Government agrees that it will be bound by the restrictive marking where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract Disputes statute until final disposition by an agency Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, following notice to the Contractor that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by such Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure of the technical data.  Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.

 

      (h)  Final disposition of appeal or suit.

 

              (1)  If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is sustained—

 

                    (i)  The restrictive marking on the technical data shall be cancelled, corrected or ignored; and

 

                    (ii)  If the restrictive marking is found not to be substantially justified, the Contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of reviewing the restrictive marking and the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in challenging the marking, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.

 

              (2)  If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is not sustained—

 

                    (i)  The Government shall continue to be bound by the restrictive marking; and

 

                    (ii)  The Government shall be liable to the Contractor or subcontractor for payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor or subcontractor in defending the marking, if the challenge by the Government is found not to have been made in good faith.

 

      (i)  Duration of right to challenge.  The Government may review the validity of any restriction on technical data, delivered or to be delivered under a contract, asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor.  During the period within three (3) years of final payment on a contract or within three (3) years of delivery of the technical data to the Government, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer may review and make a written determination to challenge the restriction.  The Government may, however, challenge a restriction on the release, disclosure or use of technical data at any time if such technical data—

 

              (1)  Is publicly available;

 

              (2)  Has been furnished to the United States without restriction; or

 

              (3)  Has been otherwise made available without restriction.  Only the Contracting Officer's final decision resolving a formal challenge by sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking constitutes “validation” as addressed in 10 U.S.C. 2321.

 

      (j)  Decision not to challenge.  A decision by the Government, or a determination by the Contracting Officer, to not challenge the restrictive marking or asserted restriction shall not constitute “validation.”

 

      (k)  Privity of contract.  The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors at any tier that assert restrictive markings.  However, this clause neither creates nor implies privity of contract between the Government and subcontractors.

 

      (l)  Flowdown.  The Contractor or subcontractor agrees to insert this clause in contractual instruments, including subcontracts and other contractual instruments for commercial items, with its subcontractors or suppliers at any tier requiring the delivery of technical data.

                     (ii)  The benefits of the invention are, to the extent permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.

 

              “Subject invention” means any invention of the Contractor made in the performance of work under this contract.

 

      (b)  Contractor’s rights.

 

              (1)  Ownership.  The Contractor may elect to retain ownership of each subject invention throughout the world in accordance with the provisions of this clause.

 

              (2)  License.

 

                    (i)  The Contractor shall retain a nonexclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, unless the Contractor fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause.  The Contractor’s license—

 

                            (A)  Extends to any domestic subsidiaries and affiliates within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a part;

 

                            (B)  Includes the right to grant sublicenses to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time of contract award; and

 

                            (C)  Is transferable only with the approval of the agency, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Contractor’s business to which the invention pertains.

 

                     (ii)  The agency—

 

                            (A)  May revoke or modify the Contractor’s domestic license to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with 37 CFR Part 404 and agency licensing regulations;

 

                            (B)  Will not revoke the license in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public; and

 

                            (C)  May revoke or modify the license in any foreign country to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.

 

                     (iii)  Before revoking or modifying the license, the agency—

 

                            (A)  Will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license; and

 

                            (B)  Will allow the Contractor 30 days (or such other time as the funding agency may authorize for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. 

 

                     (iv)  The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with 37 CFR Part 404 and agency regulations, concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.

 

      (c)  Contractor’s obligations.

 

              (1)  The Contractor shall—

 

                    (i)  Disclose, in writing, each subject invention to the Contracting Officer within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters, or within 6 months after the Contractor first becomes aware that a subject invention has been made, whichever is earlier;

 

                    (ii)  Include in the disclosure—

 

                            (A)  The inventor(s) and the contract under which the invention was made;

 

                            (B)  Sufficient technical detail to convey a clear understanding of the invention; and

 

                            (C)  Any publication, on sale (i.e., sale or offer for sale), or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication; and

 

                    (iii)  After submission of the disclosure, promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication and of any on sale or public use. 

 

              (2)  The Contractor shall elect in writing whether or not to retain ownership of any subject invention by notifying the Contracting Officer at the time of disclosure or within 8 months of disclosure, as to those countries (including the United States) in which the Contractor will retain ownership.  However, in any case where publication, on sale, or public use has initiated the 1-year statutory period during which valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States, the agency may shorten the period of election of title to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.

 

              (3)  The Contractor shall—

 

                    (i)  File either a provisional or a nonprovisional patent application on an elected subject invention within 1 year after election, provided that in all cases the application is filed prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use;

 

                    (ii)  File a nonprovisional application within 10 months of the filing of any provisional application; and

 

                    (iii)  File patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either 10 months of the first filed patent application (whether provisional or nonprovisional) or 6 months from the date the Commissioner of Patents grants permission to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.

 

              (4)  The Contractor may request extensions of time for disclosure, election, or filing under paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause.  The Contracting Officer will normally grant the extension unless there is reason to believe the extension would prejudice the Government’s interests.

 

      (d)  Government’s rights.

 

              (1)  Ownership.  The Contractor shall assign to the agency, upon written request, title to any subject invention—

 

                    (i)  If the Contractor elects not to retain title to a subject invention;

 

                    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause and the agency requests title within 60 days after learning of the Contractor’s failure to report or elect within the specified times;

 

                    (iii)  In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, provided that, if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the agency, the Contractor shall continue to retain ownership in that country; and

 

                    (iv)  In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.

 

              (2)  License.  If the Contractor retains ownership of any subject invention, the Government shall have a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States, the subject invention throughout the world.

 

      (e)  Contractor action to protect the Government’s interest.

 

              (1)  The Contractor shall execute or have executed and promptly deliver to the agency all instruments necessary to—

 

                    (i)  Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions in which the Contractor elects to retain ownership; and

 

                    (ii)  Assign title to the agency when requested under paragraph (d)(1) of this clause and enable the Government to obtain patent protection for that subject invention in any country.

 

              (2)  The Contractor shall—

 

                    (i)  Require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to—

 

                            (A)  Disclose each subject invention promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters, so that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions in paragraph (c) of this clause; and

 

                            (B)  Provide the disclosure in the Contractor’s format, which should require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this clause;

 

                    (ii)  Instruct its employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, as to the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or statutory foreign bars; and

 

                    (iii)  Execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government’s rights in the subject inventions. 

 

              (3)  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any decisions not to file a nonprovisional patent application, continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response or filing period required by the relevant patent office.

 

              (4)  The Contractor shall include, within the specification of any United States nonprovisional patent application and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement:  “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded by (identify the agency).  The Government has certain rights in this invention.”

 

              (5)  The Contractor shall—

 

                    (i)  Establish and maintain active and effective procedures to ensure that subject inventions are promptly identified and disclosed to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters;

 

                    (ii)  Include in these procedures the maintenance of—

 

                            (A)  Laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other records as are reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first actual reduction to practice of subject inventions; and

 

                            (B)  Records that show that the procedures for identifying and disclosing the inventions are followed; and

 

                    (iii)  Upon request, furnish the Contracting Officer a description of these procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their effectiveness.

 

              (6)  The Contractor shall, when licensing a subject invention, arrange to—

 

                    (i)  Avoid royalty charges on acquisitions involving Government funds, including funds derived through the Government’s Military Assistance Program or otherwise derived through the Government;

 

                    (ii)  Refund any amounts received as royalty charges on the subject inventions in acquisitions for, or on behalf of, the Government; and

 

                    (iii)  Provide for the refund in any instrument transferring rights in the invention to any party.

                    (ii)  A final report, within 3 months after completion of the contracted work, listing all subject inventions or stating that there were no subject inventions, and listing all subcontracts at any tier containing a patent rights clause or stating that there were no subcontracts.

 

              (8)(i)  The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause by identifying—

 

                            (A)  The subcontractor;

 

                            (B)  The applicable patent rights clause;

 

                            (C)  The work to be performed under the subcontract; and

 

                            (D)  The dates of award and estimated completion.

 

               (ii)  The Contractor shall furnish, upon request, a copy of the subcontract, and no more frequently than annually, a listing of the subcontracts that have been awarded.

 

              (9)  In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to accept one of the clauses specified in paragraph (l)(1) of this clause, the Contractor—

 

                    (i)  Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer setting forth the subcontractor’s reasons for the refusal and other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; and

 

                    (ii)  Shall not proceed with that subcontract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.

 

              (10)  The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer, upon request, the following information for any subject invention for which the Contractor has retained ownership:

 

                    (i)  Filing date.

 

                    (ii)  Serial number and title.

 

                    (iii)  A copy of any patent application (including an English-language version if filed in a language other than English).

 

                    (iv)  Patent number and issue date.

 

              (11)  The Contractor shall furnish to the Government, upon request, an irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of any patent application file.

 

      (f)  Reporting on utilization of subject inventions.

 

              (1)  The Contractor shall—

 

                    (i)  Submit upon request periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts in obtaining utilization of the subject invention that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees;

 

                    (ii)  Include in the reports information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and other information as the agency may reasonably specify; and

 

                    (iii)  Provide additional reports that the agency may  request in connection with any march-in proceedings undertaken by the agency in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause.

 

              (2)  To the extent permitted by law, the agency shall not disclose the information provided under paragraph (f)(1) of this clause to persons outside the Government without the Contractor’s permission, if the data or information is considered by the Contractor or its licensee or assignee to be “privileged and confidential” (see 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)) and is so marked.

 

      (g)  Preference for United States industry.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither the Contractor nor any assignee shall grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless the person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States.  However, in individual cases, the agency may waive the requirement for an exclusive license agreement upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that—

 

              (1)  Reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States; or

             

              (2)  Under the circumstances, domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

 

      (h)  March-in rights.  The Contractor acknowledges that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has retained ownership, the agency has the right to require licensing pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210(c), 37 CFR 401.6, and any supplemental regulations of the agency in effect on the date of contract award.

 

      (i)  Other inventions.  Nothing contained in this clause shall be deemed to grant to the Government any rights with respect to any invention other than a subject invention.

 

      (j)  Examination of records relating to inventions.

 

              (1)  The Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of the Contractor relating to the conception or first reduction to practice of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under this contract to determine whether—

 

                    (i)  Any inventions are subject inventions;

 

                    (ii)  The Contractor has established procedures required by paragraph (e)(5) of this clause; and

 

                    (iii)  The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the procedures.

 

              (2)  If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor invention that the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject invention, the Contractor shall be required to disclose the invention to the agency for a determination of ownership rights.

 

              (3)  Any examination of records under this paragraph (j) shall be subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.

 

      (k)  Withholding of payment (this paragraph does not apply to subcontracts).

 

              (1)  Any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may, in the Government’s interest, withhold payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount of the contract, whichever is less, is set aside if, in the Contracting Officer’s opinion, the Contractor fails to—

 

                    (i)  Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for identifying and disclosing subject inventions pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) of this clause;

 

                    (ii)  Disclose any subject invention pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this clause;

 

                    (iii)  Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this clause; or

 

                    (iv)  Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to paragraph (e)(8) of this clause.

 

              (2)  The reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other information required by this clause.

 

              (3)  The Government will not make final payment under this contract before the Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer—

 

                    (i)  All disclosures of subject inventions required by paragraph (c)(1) of this clause;

 

                    (ii)  An acceptable final report pursuant to paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of this clause; and

 

                    (iii)  All past due confirmatory instruments.

 

              (4)  The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums withheld up to the maximum authorized in paragraph (k)(1) of this clause.  No amount shall be withheld under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of the contract.  The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government right.

 

      (l)  Subcontracts.

 

              (1)  The Contractor—

 

                    (i)  Shall include the substance of the Patent Rights—Ownership by the Contractor clause set forth at 52.227-11 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), in all subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed by a small business concern or nonprofit organization; and 

 

                    (ii)  Shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (l), in all other subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work, unless a different patent rights clause is required by FAR 27.303.

 

              (2)  For subcontracts at any tier—

 

                    (i)  The patents rights clause included in the subcontract shall retain all references to the Government and shall provide to the subcontractor all the rights and obligations provided to the Contractor in the clause.  The Contractor shall not, as consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor’s subject inventions; and

 

                    (ii)  The Government, the Contractor, and the subcontractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Government with respect to those matters covered by this clause.  However, nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes statute in connection with proceedings under paragraph (h) of this clause.
